Method

Heat the grill pan to high, then line with double thickness foil and curl up the edges to catch the juices. Brush lightly with oil and put the cod on top. Sprinkle over the coriander, lemon zest and juice and drizzle with a little more of the oil. Season with salt and pepper, then grill for 10-12 mins until the fish flakes easily.
Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a pan. Add the onion and cumin and fry for a few mins. Add the carrots and stir well, then stir in the rice until glistening. Add the stock and bring to the boil. Cover and cook gently for about 10 mins until the rice is tender and the stock absorbed. Spoon the rice onto 4 warm plates, top with cod and pour over the pan juices.
