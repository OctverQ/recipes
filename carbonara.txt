Simple Carbonara

I cook this every wednesday :)
Get a deep pot with cold water and a tbsp of salt to boil, once it starts boiling add your pasta (I prefer thin lighter spaghetti type). I like my pasta cooked al-dente which takes around 12min for a generous portion of pasta but I suggest to follow the instruction found on the package.
While the pasta is cooking take a shallow pan and add some smoked pancetta in there along with a crushed garlic clove. There is alot of flavor in this meat and also some fat, for that reason I dont grease the pan. After 1min remove the garlic and discard it. 
In the mean time take 1 egg a pinch of salt and mix them in a bowl along with some parmesan, not too much just enough to cover the surface of the liquid.
Once the pasta is done and the pancetta is getting crispy, drain the pasta and added on top of the pancetta, then add the egg mix and stir so that its evenly spread. 
Remove from the fire, transfer to a bowl, add more parmesan on top (as much as you like this time).
This is a traditional recipe. 
My touch comes at the end when I like to add tomato and mascarpone sauce and chilly sauce a tbsp of each to serve with the pasta. Works a treat! Cant wait till tomorrow now :)
